<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>
 &nbsp;Hi! I'm <a href="https://github.com/aouwt/">all-other-usernames-were-taken</a> (now aouwt). You also may know me as <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/efils">efils</a> on Scratch.
 <br /><br />
 &nbsp;I enjoy programming, specifically in QuickBasic-derived languages (could you tell?) but I also enjoy Scratch, and I am currently learning 6502 assembly. I also know a tad of C and C++.
 <br /><br />
 &nbsp;Want to do a collab with me? I'm quite busy with school right now, but I might be able to find time to do a collab. <a href="https://github.com/aouwt/aouwt.github.io/discussions">Contact me here to see if I'm available!</a>
 <br /><br />
 &nbsp;Comments, questions, or suggestions? <a href="https://github.com/aouwt/aouwt.github.io/discussions">Make a comment here!</a>

<h2>What I'm currently working on:</h2>

<p>
 I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/aouwt/qb-wm/">a window manager written in QB64</a>, although calling it a window manager is kind of stretching it. More details <a href="https://redd.it/ld6o4i">here</a>.
</p>

<br />


<h2>My projects</h2>

<p>
